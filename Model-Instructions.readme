Identify the model & source

    Mistral 7B is open-source, available on Hugging Face and official repos.

    Hermes is another recent open-weight LLM, check its repo or model hub.

Download GGUF weights

    GGUF is a format used by tools like llama.cpp for efficient local inference.

    You want the model in .gguf format for compatibility with local runtimes.

Where to find GGUF files

    Some models provide pre-converted GGUF files on Hugging Face or model hubs (search model-name gguf).

    If GGUF isn’t provided, you can convert from original PyTorch/Transformers weights using community tools.

How to convert to GGUF

    Use conversion tools like convert-llama-to-gguf or related scripts.

    Example:

    python convert-llama-to-gguf.py --input model.bin --output model.gguf

    You’ll usually need the original .bin weights from Hugging Face or official releases.

Example for Mistral 7B

    Clone or download Mistral weights from Hugging Face:

    git lfs install
    git clone https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1

    Use conversion script to make .gguf from the downloaded weights.

Plugging into your AI-agent

    Place your .gguf model file into your agent’s model folder or wherever the agent loads local models.

    Update the agent config or model loader path to point to your .gguf file.

    Ensure your local runtime supports GGUF (e.g., llama.cpp backend, GPTQ compatible).
